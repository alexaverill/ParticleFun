Simple particle flocking simulator in Godot.

This simple flocking simuluation is implmenting the [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) priciples of seperation, alignment and cohesion.

In addition to the simple flocking it also implements simple obstacle avoidance. 

The end goal would be to integrate into a projection based experiance to track people and have the boids flock around them.
